So this project was strated when I first learned about security, and its flaws, so this is a short try at seeing if I can make my own ecryption algorithm. I have tried my best to make this work, I have no idea why it doesn't work. All it says is, "An unhandled exception of type 'System.NullReferenceException' occurred in Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll

Additional information: Object variable or With block variable not set."

So I need YOUR help, and see if you can aid in the completion of this project. 

Thanks a lot,
